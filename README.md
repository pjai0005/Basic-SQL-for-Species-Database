# SQL Queries for Species Database

As natural habitats disappear, it is increasingly difficult to ensure that all species can survive in the wild. One solution is to use zoos, reserves and other types of organizations that keep wild animals in captivity as conservation centres for various species. To assist in recording the animals in captivity and their offspring, a Centre Breeding database is to be created in which all centres will record the animals which they hold and the breeding events which take place at the centres.
